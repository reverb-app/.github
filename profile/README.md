# Reverb

Reverb is an open-source, **event-driven, asynchronous workflow engine** that abstracts away the logic and infrastructure developers need to orchestrate complex background tasks. Users define tasks as multi-step functions in their repository, and Reverb handles triggering and executing them step-by-step. The service is self-hosted on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) and is deployable with one command using our CLI tool.
